# NotACheatUI
100% not a cheat ui written with imgui low level drawing

header drawn using bitmap with directx11


based of submenu switch thats used in most  early/not bigbase gta cheats

its not great, code is bad,messy and overall a 2/10

im not very good at c let alone c++

but, like, it works. Which is better than nothing

#nomoredumbassYTDS

- creds to sk1d#0187 for the cool header design. :)
